      "title": "About This Project",
      "body": "This webapp is part of a project from the University of Copenhagen developed by 6 students. The main goal of our app is to provide easily available summary statistics to asylum seekers and their lawyers. Such statistics are found on the pages that you can navigate around. We hope that you are able to find the information you are looking for, and that you have a pleasant experience with our system while doing so. Every decision we have made, over the course of this project, has been to improve the usability of accessing relevant asylum data for your benefit. We have considered many ideas for how to make your asylum seeking process as simple as possible. Therefore, our webapp provides a simpler overview of statistics that others do not. Our top priority is achieving your satisfaction. Visit our university by using the below link:"
